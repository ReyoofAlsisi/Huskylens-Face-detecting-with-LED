Project Objective
The objective of this project is to utilize the HuskyLens AI camera to detect human faces. Upon detecting a face, the HuskyLens will send a signal to an Arduino, which will then activate an LED. Conversely, if no face is detected, the LED will remain off. This configuration provides a clear and direct visual feedback mechanism based on face detection.

Procedure
Setup the Arduino:
Install the Arduino IDE: Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official Arduino website if it is not already installed on your MacBook.
Connect the Arduino: Use a USB cable to connect the Arduino Uno to your MacBook.
Connect the HuskyLens:
Power and Ground: Connect the VCC pin of the HuskyLens to the 5V pin on the Arduino and the GND pin of the HuskyLens to the GND pin on the Arduino.
Communication Pins: Connect the TX pin of the HuskyLens to the RX pin (digital pin 0) on the Arduino, and connect the RX pin of the HuskyLens to the TX pin (digital pin 1) on the Arduino.
Configure the HuskyLens and Install Necessary Software:
Initial Setup: Follow the provided instructions to power on and configure the HuskyLens, ensuring it is set to face detection mode.
Install Required Software: Download and install any necessary software or applications for HuskyLens configuration from the HuskyLens official website, if applicable.
Connect the LED:
Anode (Long Leg): Connect the anode (long leg) of the LED to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 13) through a 220-ohm resistor.
Cathode (Short Leg): Connect the cathode (short leg) of the LED to the GND pin on the Arduino.
Connect the 220-ohm Resistor:
In Series with the LED: Connect one end of the 220-ohm resistor to the anode of the LED and the other end to the digital pin on the Arduino. This resistor is essential for current limiting to protect the LED.

  
Summary
This project involves integrating the HuskyLens AI camera with an Arduino to enable face detection. The HuskyLens communicates with the Arduino to control an LED based on face detection: the LED will light up if a face is detected and remain off otherwise. The project includes setting up the Arduino, connecting the HuskyLens and LED, and incorporating a resistor to ensure the LED operates safely. This setup effectively demonstrates the application of face detection technology for providing visual feedback.
